  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Make dough: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. <br>  
      Add eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. <br>  
      Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. <br>  
      Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes. 
    </li><br>
    <li>Make filling: Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; <br>  
      drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper <br>  
      in a medium bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.  
    </li><br>
    <li>Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.
    </li><br>
    <li>Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, <br>  
      roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle as thin as possible. <br>  
      Cut into 2-inch squares using a knife or pastry wheel.  
    </li><br>
    <li>Place about 2 teaspoons filling in the center of each square. <br>  
      Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. <br>  
      Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.  
    </li><br>
    <li>Make oil: Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until <br>  
      pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm.
    </li><br>
    <li>Make sauce: Stir together yogurt and garlic in a small bowl; set aside.
    </li><br>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. <br>  
      Cook manti in boiling water until filling is no longer pink and dough is tender, <br>  
      20 to 25 minutes. Drain well.
    </li><br>
    <li>Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and drizzle with pepper oil.
    </li><br>

      
  </ol>
