  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers</li>
    <li>1 Â¾ pounds ground pork</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    <li>5 cups finely shredded Chinese cabbage</li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, <br>
      sesame oil, egg and cabbage. Stir until well mixed.
    </li><br>
    <li>Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. <br>
      Moisten edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape. <br> 
      Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside <br>
      on a lightly floured surface until ready to cook.
    </li><br>
    <li>Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer <br>
      so they don't touch to prevent them from sticking together; <br>
      steam for 15 minutes, or until pork is cooked through.
    </li><br>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!
    </li>
  </ol>
